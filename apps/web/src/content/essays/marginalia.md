Marginalia is a small library of notes. It is built for quiet reading and
steady attention, not for feeds, metrics, or reaction.

Each essay starts as a markdown file in this repository and ships as a static
page. There are no accounts, comments, or trackers. The work is the writing,
and the pace is intentional.

If you are here, take your time. Read slowly. Return when you want.
