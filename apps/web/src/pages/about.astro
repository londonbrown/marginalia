  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Marginalia is a quiet corner for short essays and field notes. It values
    slow reading, small scope, and the kinds of ideas that benefit from time.

  <p>
    Everything here is written in Markdown and published as static pages. No
    accounts, no comments, no feeds beyond the RSS.
